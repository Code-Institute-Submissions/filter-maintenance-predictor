        f'* **The client** is the business we are providing a Machine Learning (ML) solution for.\n'
        f'* *The stakeholder** is a team, business or entity involved with the development of the machine '
        f'learning model.\n'
        f'* **A user** is a person or business looking to use the model to inform business decisions.\n '
        f'* **A prospect** is a potential new customer\n '
        f'* **The project** is the plan and delivery of a ML solution to meet a variety of requirements' 
        f'to Predict Maintenance of a replaceable part.\n\n'

        f'**Industry Specific Terminology**\n'
        f'* **A replaceable part** for this project, is considered a filter mat made out of ' 
        f'randomly oriented, non-woven fibre material.\n '
        f'* A **Life test** is the entire test cycle from the first instance of a Data_No to the last.\n '
        f'* The **Filter degradation process** is the gradual performance decline over time, '
        f'which can be quantified and used by statistical models.\n '
        f'* **Right censored data** is where “failure” has/will occur after the recorded time.\n '
        f'* **Filter failure** is when the **differential pressure** across the filter **exceeds 600 Pa**.\n '
        f'* **Zone of Failure** is the last 10% of RUL for that replacement part.\n'
        f'* **The Threshold** is the actual time when the experiment exceeded the threshold,'
        f'(used to define when the observations pass into the zone of failure).\n'
        
        f'**Project Dataset**\n\n'
        f'The dataset represents a collection of test measures obtained from the **Power Technique division** '
        f'of an **Industrial Solutions company**. \n''It contains testing data that relates to:\n'
        f'* The **change in performance of a replaceable filter part** '
        f'(like difference in pressure and estimated remaining useful life)\n'
        f'* **Feeding rates** (like dust feed, flow rate and sampling rate in seconds) and\n'
        f'* **Materials filtered** (type of dust fed into the testing system).'
